Genetic Algorithm based optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem. <br />

The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?". It generalises the well-known travelling salesman problem (TSP).
